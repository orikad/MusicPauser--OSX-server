##MusicPauser OS X server.

Currently only supports iTunes (I do accepts pull requests though :P).

Pauses your iTunes music while in a phone call (needs [MusicPauser iOS Client](https://github.com/orikad/MusicPauser--iOS-client)).

Warning:
Notice that this server does not verify its clients. It does not ask you before a clients gets a permission to pause/play/query iTunes.
This only means that anyone on your local network can pause/play iTunes on your computer and query if it's currently playing, if this is an issue for you, do not use it in its current form.
